Events in JavaScript are actions triggered by the user or the browser. They can be things like clicking a button, moving the mouse, scrolling a page, or pressing a key.
JavaScript interacts with HTML through these events. For example, when the page loads or when a user clicks a button, these are events that JavaScript can respond to.

Example:
``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<button onclick="alert('Hello World!')">Click me!</button>

</body>
</html>
```
